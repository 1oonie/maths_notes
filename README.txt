I thought that writing up my A-Level Maths notes as a website 
would be more fun than just slogging it out with my stylus.

I was wrong.

It has been a journey of self-discovery, MathML, and comfortable
matrices. We're not even a fraction of the way there.

Don't read the HTML; MathML is incomprehensible. Go to 
https://1oonie.github.io/maths_notes instead.
